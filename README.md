# Programming Project 3 <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" alt="" width="120" />

> Programming Project 3 aims to create a median-of-three Quick Sort algorithm that runs more efficiently
> than a regular Quick Sort by choosing the pivot value from a median-of-three values from the array.
> 
> Given an array, a[i],...,[aj] with j-i>=2, let k=(i+j)/2 where k is a floor representation of an integer. 
> We will choose the median value amongst a[i], a[j], a[k] if those three values were sorted as the partition element.
> The median-of-three Quick Sort algorithm will follow the regular Quick Sort algorithm on page 171 of the CLRS text.

## Project Requirements

An algorithm will be defined using pseudocode.
The average case and worst-case running time will be determined.

  1. Determine the average case asymptotic behavior of median-of-three Quick Sort.
  2. Determine the worst case asymptotic behavior of median-of-three Quick Sort.
  3. Determine the worst case asymptotic behavior of median-of-three Quick Sort on a sorted array.
  4. Implement a regular QUICKSORT.
  5. Implement a median-of-three QUICKSORT.
  6. Test your implementations for asymptotic complexity.
  7. Trace your implementations for proper functioning of code.
